		<h4>What</h4>
		<p>ContactPusher is an enhancement to Google Contacts that allows you to quickly share contact information in a way that provides recipients an easy method to import or download that information, with future updates pushed directly to their Google account or even via email.</p>
		<h4>Why</h4>
		<p>When you send an email to all your friends letting them know you've moved, do you really think they'll update their address books? Yeah, neither do we. So we built this. It takes the pain away by pushing the updates to them.</p>

	<h3>How it Works: 3 Easy Steps</h3>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="row-fluid marketing">
	<div class="span6">
		<h4>Step 1</h4>
		<p>Authorize ContactPusher to connect to your Google Contacts account and choose the contact you want to share.</p>
		<h4>Step 2</h4>
		<p>We generate a unique url for you to give to family and friends, providing them easy methods for downloading or importing the information into their own Google Contacts account.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h4>Step 3</h4>
		<p>We periodically check to see if the information in the shared contact has changed, and push updates when it has.</p>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="row-fluid marketing">
	<div class="span6">
		<h4>What information do you store from my Google Contacts Account?</h4>
		<p>We store the bare minimum of information required to complete the task. When you authorize ContactPusher to connect to your Google Contacts account, we save your email address and your unique identifier provided to us by Google.</p>
		<h4>Are you going to spam me?</h4>
		<p>Nope. There isn't even a welcome email! We strive to never send unsolicited email. We may send you important notifications about the service, but most likely you'll never hear from us unless you reach out.</p>
		<h4>Can I share multiple contacts?</h4>
		<p>Yes. Each contact you choose creates a unique url for you to share. If you want to setup multiple contacts with different levels of information to share with different people, no problem.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h4>How often are updates pushed?</h4>
		<p>Updates are pushed to Google Contacts approximately every 48 hours; while updates over email are sent monthly, when needed.</p>
		<h4>Doesn't Google already offer this?</h4>
		<p><a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1069629?hl=en">Kinda</a>, but it sucks.</p>
		<h4>How do I revoke access?</h4>
		<p><a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41236">Google</a> has you covered on this one, but if you revoke access from ContactPusher, you won't be able to send or receive updates from any shared contacts.</p>
		<h4>Is this the last question?</h4>
		<p>No. We are sure you have plenty more. Please, <a href="mailto:support@technosushi.com">ask away</a>.</p>
