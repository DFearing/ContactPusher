ContactPusher
=============

A simple way to share contact information via Google contacts.

NOTE: I started this project March 15, 2013. It was deployed sometime around March 22, 2013. The project was later abandoned before being completed due to lack of interest from the public. The auto-update feature and ability to download contact info instead of importing it directly into Google contacts was never built, although both would be trivial features to complete.
